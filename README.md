Book Review App version 1.0

This book app connects to 2 APIS:
1. Zxing 
2. Goodreads

it works by, reading barcode from a book with Zxing API. User will retrieve a isbn number back. Thus the number will be used to search for correct Book title, image, and average rating from Goodreads and display it in app.

App is a little slow, and alot of processing is done on main thread, however, slow, it works.
